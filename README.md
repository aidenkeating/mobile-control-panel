# mobile-control-panel (mcp)
The mobile control panel aims to help mobile developers working with and integrating with mobile enabled services on OpenShift. It provides a mobile centric view and set of features designed to enable mobile developers to focus on building great mobile applications with deep server side integrations to powerful services such as server side data sync, push notification, authentication etc without necessarily worrying about how to provision and configure those services to work with their mobile clients.

This repo has 3 main parts:

1) ```./server``` The api server which serves as the server side logic for the mcp UI. 

2) ```./ui``` The mcp ui. This is an extension to the OpenShift UI to give a mobile centric view and set of features.

3) ```./docs``` This holds design docs, architectural docs, use cases and development guides etc.
